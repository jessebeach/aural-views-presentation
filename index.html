            <p>[Wim] Hi I'm Wim Leers.</p>
            <p>[Jesse] And I'm Jesse Beach. I work at Acquia on the Spark team as a front end developer.</p>
            <p>This is a session about making data and interactions accessible everyone.</p>
            <p>[Wim] So we're talking about accessibility, right?</p>
            <p>[Jesse] Yes, but first I must admit that I am not an accessibility expert.</p>
            <p>[Wim] And neither am I.</p>
            <p>[Jesse] What we are, are two front end developers with a passion for beautiful, usable and delightful UIs. And given that all of you out there — front-end developers, usability experts, UX designers, back-end developers, doc writers, community organizers — of course feel the same way, then we are all, therefore, concerned with accessibility. Because accessibility is about creating rich experiences for everyone.</p>
            <p>[Wim] A rich experience is one that anyone, regardless of the range of their abilities, finds satisfying. That means, given a task, they can understand what actions they need to undertake, how to undertake them, what the results of those actions are and that the task completed successfully or not.</p>
            <p>[Jesse] A rich experience is also one that provides awareness of possibilities and constraints, because as humans, we don't always know what we want to do until we've explored a bit.</p>
            <p>[Wim] We find inspiration through interaction and that is what a rich UI does, it inspires and encourages.</p>

              <p>In trying to determine the scale of the effort to bring the aural experience of Drupal's interface up to the same level of polish of the visual UI, we wanted to understand just how far apart they might be.</p>
              <p>So we put together this chart that plots the visual and aural UI experiences from a lower bound of inaccessible (a value of 0) to an upper bound of delightful interaction (a value of 4).</p>
              <p>We might say that the visual content consumption experience of Drupal ranges from 2.5 to 3.5.</p>
              <p>The visual site administration experience ranges from a 2 to 3.5</p>
              <p>The aural content consumption experience ranges from 1.5 to 3</p>
              <p>The aural site administration experience ranges from 0 to 3</p>
              <p>We propose that the aural site administration experience -- managing content, managing views, configuring a site -- has the most variability in experience within Drupal.</p>
              <p>As developers, we have tended to focus our accessibility improvements on static markup which is important, but it's only half the story.</p>

              <p>So let's move from our brief introduction to accessibility in Drupal to the work currently underway to make it even better.</p>
              <p>[Wim] Modern UIs are complex. As we introduce just-in-time information and dynamically updating pages, we also introduce new design patterns to express to the user that their page contents have changed: spinner icons, quick flashes of color, shifting boxes, fade in effects. Almost exclusively, these indicators are visual. While we were helping to improve authoring experience tools for Drupal 8, we realized that Drupal is, too, evolving into a complex and dynamic front end application. That we need to express to the user when and how their interface has updated. And that we need to do this within Drupal's guidelines. We can't only express updates visually because for users who are blind, our UIs are frustratingly silent about what's going on.</p>

              <p>[Wim] Let's have another look at how tabbing is constrained when the user enables edit mode and then opens the overlay. Note how the edit mode tabbing constraint is restored after the overlay tabbing constraint context is removed.</p>
              <p>[Wim] The tabbing constraint contexts do not need to be managed by any module. If your module releases its constraints, but that constraint is overridden and not active, it will not be activated again later.</p>

Backbone Models of the same type may be grouped in Backbone Collections if that is useful for the use case. Backbone Models are connected to Backbone Views via model event bindings, so that Backbone Views are able to update themselves whenver the data/state changes.

              <p>Note that in Backbone.js, the View is a combination of a View and Controller. The Models are intentionally kept dumb, to make it easy to hook up new Views. Since the DOM also combines rendering (HTML elements rendered in a certain way) and event handling (DOM event handling), and the View is the connection to the DOM, this feels natural.<br />
              However, if you prefer a full separation, then it's entirely possible to have Views that are solely listening for events and updating the bound Model, and separate Views that are responsible for rendering.</p>
